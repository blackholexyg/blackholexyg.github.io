                I got my Ph.D. from Northwestern where I worked with Professor <a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/huang-yonggang.html" target="_blank">Yonggang Huang</a> on mechanics modeling and design of stretchable electronics and microfluidic devices. I have published more than 40 papers in journals, including top multidisciplinary journals such as <i>Nature</i>, <i>Science Advances</i>, <i>Nature Communications</i>, and top mechanics journal like <i>JMPS</i>.
