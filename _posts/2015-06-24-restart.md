After 2 Weeks' work on the website, my personal blog is finally online again!

#### Some Notes on New Blog

Currently the whole website is written with HTML/CSS from scratch. Everything follows the [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) standard. Responsive design and search engine optimization (SEO) are also considered throughout the development process.

The same as my previous version, the whole website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a very light-weight but powerful site generator. Using Jekyll, I can easily write posts using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), my favorite markup document format with very simple and elegant grammar. [YAML](http://yaml.org/) front matter and [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) template make Jekyll super cool. Basically it supports every need I can imagine for a blog site. And it's static, which makes the whole site much easier to deploy.

During the development process, I enjoined learning these web development technologies a lot. These technologies just emerge in very recent years but have been getting popular very quickly. This is the success of the spirit free sharing -- everyone have access and everyone can contribute. I benefit a lot from the open source community and I really hope I can also contribute my efforts to the community as well.
