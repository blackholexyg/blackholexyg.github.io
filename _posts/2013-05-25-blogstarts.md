My first personal blog starts here!!!

I will publish some personal updates, new knowledge I learned, my original research, literature summary or comments of other things. Of course, I will also show off some web development technologies here.

This light-weight blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's simple but really cool! I will write more about using Jekyll in later blog posts. Currently the whole website is written with HTML/CSS from scratch. Responsive design and search engine optimization (SEO) is considered throughout the development process.

Other technologies used include

* [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
