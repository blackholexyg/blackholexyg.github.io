It has been too long since my last blog post. It's always hard to stick to something for me. However, to regularly maintain a personal blog site has always been on my To-Do list. Actually I always view the blog/diary far more than simply note trivial details of life and complain about the world. It's a kind of  reflection and represents a more active life to me. Every time I feel lost, I turn to diary. Writing brings me peace and courage.

Life in US is lonely. Not many friends, and close friends even fewer. But it's not a bad thing. Learning, thinking are all things of someone's own. The following several years will be great for me to better improve myself.
