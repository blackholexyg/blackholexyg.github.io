### Getting and Cleaning Data Content

* Raw vs. tidy data
* Downloading files
* Reading data
* Excel, XML, JSON, MySQL, HDF5, Web, ...
* Merging data
* Reshaping data
* Summarizing data
* Finding and replacing
* Data resources

{% highlight R linenos %}
mergedData2 <- merge(reviews, solutions,
  by.x = "solution_id", by.y = "id", all = TRUE)
head(mergedData2[, 1:6], 3)
reviews[1, 1:6]
{% endhighlight %}

Exploratory Analysis Content

* Principles of Analytic Graphics
* Exploratory graphs
* Plotting Systems in R
  - base
  - lattice
  - ggplot2
* Hierarchical clustering
* K-Means clustering
* Dimension reduction

Principles of Analytic Graphics

* Principle 1: Show comparisons
* Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation
* Principle 3: Show multivariate data
* Principle 4: Integrate multiple modes of evidence
* Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence
* Principle 6: Content is king

* R packages provide a powerful mechanism for extending the functionality of R
* R packages can be obtained from CRAN or other repositories
{% highlight R linenos %}
install.packages("slidify")
install.packages(c("slidify", "ggplot2", "devtools")) 
{% endhighlight %}
*
The install.packages() can be used to install packages at the R console

The library() function loads packages that have been installed so that you may access the functionality in the package
